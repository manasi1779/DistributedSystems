/**
 * The algorithm is defined through two rules, the marker receiving rule and the
marker sending rule. The marker sending rule obligates processes to send
a marker after they have recorded their state, but before they send any other messages.
The marker receiving rule obligates a process that has not recorded its state to do
so. In that case, this is the first marker that it has received. It notes which messages
subsequently arrive on the other incoming channels. When a process that has already
saved its state receives a marker (on another channel), it records the state of that channel
as the set of messages it has received on it since it saved its state.
